# Contributing

Thank you for contributing! To keep the repository consistent and easy to review, please follow the rules below.

This is a proprietary project. Do not use or modify the project, or submit a
contribution, without the copyright holder's prior express written permission.
Submitting a contribution does not grant any right to the existing project.

## Language

- All repository content (issues, PR titles and descriptions, comments, commit messages, documentation, and code comments) must be written in English.

## Branch naming

- Create branches using the following pattern:
    - `<type>/<short-description>`
    - Optionally include an issue or ticket id: `<type>/JIRA-123-short-description` or `<type>/123-short-description`
- Allowed `type` prefixes:
    - `feat`, `fix`, `hotfix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `ci`, `chore`, `perf`, `style`, `build`, `release`, `revert`
- Examples:
    - `feat/add-login-endpoint`
    - `fix/handle-null-response`
    - `refactor/auth-middleware`
    - `ci/update-workflow-triggers`

## Commit messages

- Use Conventional Commits (in English) for all commit messages:
    - Official spec: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
- Examples:
    - `feat(auth): add refresh token endpoint`
    - `fix(api): return 403 when authorization fails`
    - `chore(deps): bump laravel/framework to vX.Y.Z`
- Keep commits small and focused. If a change requires multiple logical steps, use multiple commits.

## Pull requests

- Open your PR targeting the `dev` branch (not `main`).
- PR title should be descriptive; using Conventional Commit style in the title is encouraged (e.g. `fix(auth): ...`).
- In the PR description include:
    - A short summary of what the PR changes.
    - Any linked issue/ticket (e.g. `Closes #123`).
    - Testing instructions and expected results.
    - Notes about breaking changes, if any.
- Ensure automated checks (CI / linters / tests) pass before requesting a review.

## Reviews and merging

- Request a review from an admin or the repository owner: `vraiSlophil`.
- Do NOT merge your own PR. A PR must be approved by another reviewer (admin or owner) before merging.
- The PR may only be merged after:
    - All required CI checks have passed.
    - Required approvals have been obtained.
- Recommended branch protection (ask repository admins to enable):
    - Require status checks to pass before merging.
    - Require at least one approving review.
    - Dismiss stale approvals when new commits are pushed.
    - Restrict who can push to protected branches (e.g., `dev`, `main`).

## Tests

- Add or update tests for behavioral changes.
- Make sure tests run locally and pass in CI.
- For API changes, include feature tests that cover allowed and forbidden scenarios where applicable.

## Git hooks (recommended)

- This repo includes a versioned pre-commit hook that formats with Prettier then runs ESLint.
- Enable it once on your machine:
    - `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
- The hook runs inside the `nuxt` Docker Compose service (so host Node/npm is not required).
- To bypass hooks (not recommended): `git commit --no-verify`

## Linting and formatting

- ESLint uses the Nuxt preset and enforces 4-space indentation.
- Lint: `docker compose run --rm nuxt npm run lint`
- Auto-fix: `docker compose run --rm nuxt npm run lint:fix`
- Prettier: `docker compose run --rm nuxt npm run format`
- Prettier check: `docker compose run --rm nuxt npm run format:check`

## Documentation and changelog

- Update relevant documentation and/or README when introducing new features or changing behavior.
- For user-facing changes, consider adding an entry to the changelog or release notes.

## Additional guidelines

- Keep PRs small and focused — they are easier to review.
- When applicable, include screenshots, curl examples, or sample requests/responses.
- Use descriptive commit messages and PR descriptions to help reviewers understand the intent.
